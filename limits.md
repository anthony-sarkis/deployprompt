# Foundation Models

As of March 29 2023, We support OpenAI models. We plan to add support for all popular open source and foundation model providers.

## DALLÂ·E 2

## ChatGPT

- GPT 4
- GPT 3.5 Turbo (Default)

  3.5 is Default because 4 is on waitlist for some people.

# Pro Version

- Share private links / teams

[Join the waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUTecY36t3YE4MV1avYEHWoOnUZqhwrPVR_ZVEwR4Cb8i4DQ/viewform) to get early access to Pro version and features.

# GPT-4 Limits

- Requires OpenAI approval for your account/OpenAI Key.
- If you do not have approval than you may get random errors.
- Slower than GPT-3.5
- More expensive per token.
